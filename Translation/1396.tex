1. In a village with a population of 1000 people, 200 people have contracted a certain disease. A test can diagnose the disease, but the result has an error, meaning it declares a sick person healthy with a probability of 5% and a healthy person sick with a probability of 5%. A person is randomly selected from the people of this village and tested. What is the probability that the person is declared sick?
