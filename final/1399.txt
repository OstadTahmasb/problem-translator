10. Ali and Reza each choose a 3-term arithmetic sequence of positive real numbers and write it on their paper from left to right. Then, they place both papers side by side and compare the terms of the sequences one by one. They write the result as a sequence of the letters "B", "K", and "M" on the board from left to right. If the \(i\)-th term of Ali's sequence is greater than the \(i\)-th term of Reza's sequence, they write the letter "B"; if it is smaller, they write the letter "K"; and if they are equal, they write the letter "M" as the \(i\)-th term of the result sequence on the board. For example, if Ali's sequence is \(2, 3, 4\) and Reza's sequence is \(1, 4, 7\), the result sequence will be "K, K, B".
