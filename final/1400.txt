4. In a lottery for a loan from a home-based interest-free fund among oli, Rza, and Mhmd, the following procedure is used. First, the letters of each person's name are written on separate pieces of paper. For example, the letter "o" is written once and the letter "m" is written twice. Then, these 10 pieces of paper are placed inside a vase. Each time, one piece of paper is drawn from the vase. If with some of the letters drawn so far, we can form a person's name, that person is the winner; otherwise, another letter is drawn from the vase. For example, if the letters "h", "l", "a", "o", and "i" have been drawn so far, Ali is the winner. Which of the following options is correct?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The lottery is fair and everyone has an equal chance of winning.
    \item Ali's chance of winning is between 50\% and 60\%.
    \item Reza's chance of winning is less than one-third.
    \item Reza and Ali have an equal chance of winning.
    \item Options 1 and 4 are correct.

23. Initially, a natural number is written on the board. In the next step, we first multiply it by the smallest possible natural number to make it a perfect square, and then we write its square root on the board instead of the initial number. We repeat this process on the new number and replace the previous numbers with the new ones. How many three-digit natural numbers can be transformed into the number 10 by performing the above operation at most four times? For example, if the number 24 is initially written, it is replaced by the number 12 because the smallest perfect square multiple of 24 is 144, and its square root is 12.
