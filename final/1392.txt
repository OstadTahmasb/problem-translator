10. The Ministry of Roads and Urban Development has constructed a highway of length $2^19 = 524288$ meters between Zahedan and Mashhad. It intends to equip this highway with lighting in a long-term project.

11. If we have a calculator with the ability to display very large numbers, it consists of a display screen and buttons numbered from 1 to 9. By pressing each button, the number on the display screen is immediately multiplied by the number corresponding to that button, and the result is displayed in place of the previous number on the screen. If initially the number 1 is displayed on the screen, how many times must the multiplication buttons be used to obtain the number $2^{2014} \times 3^{1435} \times 5^{1392}$? (For example, it is possible to achieve $729$ with three uses of the multiplication button, because $9 \times 9 \times 9 = 729$.)
