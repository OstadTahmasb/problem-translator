1. In a village with a population of 1000 people, 200 people have contracted a certain disease. A test can diagnose the disease, but it has an error rate, meaning it incorrectly identifies a sick person as healthy with a probability of 5\% and a healthy person as sick with a probability of 5\%. A person is randomly selected from the people of this village and tested. What is the probability that the person is declared sick?

8. The main number of a car license plate consists of a two-digit number on the left, one of the alphabet letters in the middle, and a three-digit number on the right. The digit zero is not used in these two numbers. To each plate, we assign the product of the two numbers mentioned. For example, to the plate $12b365$, we assign the number $12 \times 365 = 4380$. What is the average of the numbers assigned to all possible plates?\\
