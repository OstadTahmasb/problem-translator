18. Alice in Wonderland has been imprisoned by a malicious mathematician in a classroom. Alice must work on a mathematical puzzle for a week and at the end, tell the mathematician the answer, and she will only be freed if her answer is correct. The large classroom where Alice is imprisoned has a very large board on which the numbers $2, 3, 4, \ldots, 1000$ are initially written in order. On the $i$-th day, Alice must consider the $i$-th number written on the board as $a$, then divide each number on the board, denoted as $b$, by the greatest common divisor of that number and $a$, and write the result in place of $b$ on the board (for example, at the end of the first day, the numbers on the board become $1, 3, 2, 5, 3, \ldots 999, 500$). The answer to the puzzle is the number of ones written on the board at the end of the seventh day (for example, at the end of the first day, there is one number 1 on the board). If you were with Alice, could you quickly calculate the final answer and save Alice? If so, enter the answer in the answer sheet.
