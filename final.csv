First, the letters of each person's name are written on separate pieces of paper. For example, the letter ""o"" is written once and the letter ""m"" is written twice. Then, these 10 pieces of paper are placed inside a vase. Each time, one piece of paper is drawn from the vase. If with some of the letters drawn so far, we can form a person's name, that person is the winner; otherwise, another letter is drawn from the vase. For example, if the letters ""h"", ""l"", ""a"", ""o"", and ""i"" have been drawn so far, Ali is the winner. Which of the following options is correct?
